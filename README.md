# getexpiry
 Lists the days until a URL registry expires
 
 *This is intended to be one part of a site that counts down the the days until a list of URLs expires.*
 *I wanted to create this portion to see how it would be done, I may or may not continue creating this*
 **As it's not an important project for me.*
